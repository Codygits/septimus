# Configuration

## Mod Organizer 2 Profiles
Two profiles are pre-configured in MO2 for you. Septimus - Anniversary Edition and Septimus. If you do not own anniversary edition and all creation club content, play the standard Septimus profile. It contains all mods that do not require creation club integration.

## Creation Club Setup
In order to use Creation Club content, Mod Organizer 2 will need a copy of the creation club mod files. 
+ Launch the game from steam and allow all creation club content to download
+ Copy all files from Skyrim Special Edition/data beginning with "cc" (example: ccvsvsse004-beafarmer.bsa) into the [NoDelete] Creation Club at the top of the mod list
+ Activate the Anniversary Edition profile in Mod Organizer 2 at the top of the window
+ Ensure that all creation club content is activated in the "Plugins" tab on the right of mod organizer 2 and moved to the top of the load order
+ If it is not all activated and sent to the top, shift click to select all, right click and hit enable selected, and then right click and hit send to -> top

## Mod Configuration

### MCM Menus
All MCM menus have been automated so you are good to ignore them unless you want to change anything.

### ENB
To enable ENB, do the following:
+ Run ENB Organizer from the exe list in the top right of MO2
+ If the program warns about not being able to check for updates, simply click ok and ignore it

+ Go to presets on the left menu and enable the enb binaries and one preset

+ Low spec users or first time players may want to choose the Cathedral Minimalist profile to start

### TK Dodge
If you wish to change the dodge key, do the following:
+ Double click on the TK Dodge RE mod in SEPTIMUS - SKELETON & ANIMATION
+ Navigate to the ini files tab
+ On line line 5, change DodgeHotkey to your prefered one by using instructions [here](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Input_Script#DXScanCodes)

### Performance Guide
If you are having performance troubles and you wish to gain some extra frames, you can use [this](https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/performance-guide/) guide to tweak some settings for better performance. Additionally, try turning off the high performance SSE Display Tweaks configuration file in the optional files section.
