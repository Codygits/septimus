# Installation

## .NET 5.0 Runtime

With the Scrambled Bugs update requiring .Net 5.0, the game will not launch without this being installed. Please ensure you have .NET v5.0 installed. Download the desktop and console x64 app installers from Microsoft here: [Download .NET 5.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).

## Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE)

This list fully supports anniversary edition and all creation club content. Make sure your game is fully up to date in steam. It will automatically be patched by Wabbajack to work out of the box, but requires the latest game files.

You can simply double click on the .wabbajack archive or go to "install from disk" and select the septimus wabbajack archive there.
