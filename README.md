# Overview
Septimus is an addon for The Phoenix Flavour (TPF) which adds new items, quests, and optional survival elements on top of the fantastic base that Phoenix has created.

## List Contents
https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/septimus

# Installation

## .NET 5.0 Runtime

With the Scrambled Bugs update requiring .Net 5.0, the game will not launch without this being installed. Please ensure you have .NET v5.0 installed. Download the desktop and console x64 app installers from Microsoft here: [Download .NET 5.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).

## Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE)

This list fully supports anniversary edition and all creation club content. Make sure your game is fully up to date in steam. It will automatically be patched by Wabbajack to work out of the box, but requires the latest game files.

## Wabbajack

Download the latest release of `Septimus.wabbajack` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-VIcggcf49sTHnqQgyifhTSGwgcKd6Jz?usp=sharing) and open with [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) automated list installer. You can simply double click on the .wabbajack archive or go to "install from disk" and select the septimus wabbajack archive there.

# Configuration

## Mod Organizer 2 Profiles
Two profiles are present. Septimus - Anniversary Edition and Septimus. If you do not own anniversary edition and all creation club content, play the standard Septimus profile.

## Creation Club Setup
In order to use Creation Club content, Mod Organizer 2 will need a copy of the creation club mod files. 
+ Copy all files from Skyrim Special Edition/data beginning with "cc" (example: ccvsvsse004-beafarmer.bsa) into the [NoDelete] Creation Club at the top of the mod list
+ Activate the Anniversary Edition profile in Mod Organizer 2 at the top of the window
