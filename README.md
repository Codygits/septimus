It also has full Anniversary Edition support including all the new creation club content for those eager to get right into the new content.

# Installation

## .NET 5.0 Runtime

With the Scrambled Bugs update requiring .Net 5.0, the game will not launch without this being installed. Please ensure you have .NET v5.0 installed. Download the desktop and console x64 app installers from Microsoft here: [Download .NET 5.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).

## Skyrim: Anniversary Edition (AE)

This list fully supports anniversary edition and all creation club content. Make sure your game is fully up to date in steam. It will automatically be patched by Wabbajack to work out of the box, but requires the latest game files.

## Wabbajack

Download the latest release of `Septimus.wabbajack` from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-VIcggcf49sTHnqQgyifhTSGwgcKd6Jz?usp=sharing) and open with [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) automated list installer. You can simply double click on the .wabbajack archive or go to "install from disk" and select the septimus wabbajack archive there.

# Configuration

## Mod Organizer 2 Profiles
Two profiles are present. Septimus - Anniversary Edition and Septimus. If you do not own anniversary edition and all creation club content, play the standard Septimus profile.

## Creation Club Setup
In order to use Creation Club content, Mod Organizer 2 will need a copy of the creation club mod files. 
+ Launch the game from steam and allow all creation club content to download
+ Copy all files from Skyrim Special Edition/data beginning with "cc" (example: ccvsvsse004-beafarmer.bsa) into the [NoDelete] Creation Club at the top of the mod list
+ Activate the Anniversary Edition profile in Mod Organizer 2 at the top of the window
+ Ensure that all creation club content is activated in the "Plugins" tab on the right of mod organizer 2 and moved to the top of the load order
+ If it is not all activated and sent to the top, shift click to select all, right click and hit enable selected, and then right click and hit send to -> top
