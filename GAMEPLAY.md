## Alternate Start

By default, Septimus uses the traditional Skyrim opening scene with you as a prisoner riding on a carriage to your intended execution.

Septimus includes three alternative start mods, and you can optionally use MO2 to [enable](https://github.com/Guitarninja2/septimus/blob/main/CONFIGURATION.md#alternate-start) one of these mods to start your Skyrim journey on a different path. Instructions for how to do that are [here](https://github.com/Guitarninja2/septimus/blob/main/CONFIGURATION.md#alternate-start).

The goal is to have more intense fights with less cheap deaths. The only killcam still enabled is the view that's shown when you're already dead. | `Default: Disabled`                                                                                                                      | `2.0.0` |         |

| [Time Format Changer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28921)                          | I always hated how the in-game clock was in a 12 hour format, without any way to change it. While making a mod to change it, I decided to replace the entire time/date format used by the game to a custom one.                                               | Default: `Disabled`                                                                                                                      | `2.0.0` |         |
