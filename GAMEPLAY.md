- [Time Format Changer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28921) `2.0.0` - I always hated how the in-game clock was in a 12 hour format, without any way to change it. While making a mod to change it, I decided to replace the entire time/date format used by the game to a custom one.

- Septimus Apothecary - Easy Mode `2.0.0` - Switches Apothecary potion effects from "over time" to immediate

- Septimus Sus Main Menu Music and Sus Intro Video `2.0.0` - Enable at your own risk. You have been warned.

## Adjusted Minimum Levels

To maintain balance, Septimus uses [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464), [Rebalancing Anniversary Edition - Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004), and [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427) to adjust the required minimum level of various quests and content.
